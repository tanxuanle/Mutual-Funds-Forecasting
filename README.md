# Mutual-Funds-Forecasting

The project aims to conduct a comparative analysis between machine learning models for forecasting the performance of mutual funds from the technology sector. The dataset used was obtained from the CRSP database. 

## Directory Structure
* plots/ - Contains visualisation outputs for alpha and Sharpe ratio results
* raw_data/ - Stores raw mutual fund data
* results_alpha/ - Stores results related to the model training with alpha as the target variable
* results_sharpe/ - Stores results related to the model training with Sharpe ratio as the target variable
* wilfred_testing/ - Used for testing and experimental implementations

* data_extraction.ipynb - Extracts and preprocesses fund data
* df_ff_factors.csv / df_ff_factors_010225.csv – Factor model data files
* training_code_alpha.ipynb – Model training codes for alpha
* training_code_sharpe_ratio.ipynb - Model training codes for the Sharpe ratio
